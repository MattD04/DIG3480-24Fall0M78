Edited version of the Fighter Planes F24 as taught in class.

Player should no longer move out of top and bottom of screen
New "Enemy" made as an Cylinder object, arrives from right to left.
Known Issue: Player can't reach the very top of the scree, but can reach the bottom

Note: I messed up the names it seems, this should be week 11 not 10 whoops
